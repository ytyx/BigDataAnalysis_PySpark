Our project aims to discover the layers of information within the lage dataset of a UK-based and registered non-store online retail entity. <br>
This dataset contains Invoice details, StockCodes, Product Descriptions, Quantity, Invoice Dates, Prices, Customer IDs, and Country. In the overview of our project, we delve into data analysis and insights across three significant dimensions of our dataset: <b>Country, Product, and Customer</b>. This detailed understanding could provide the company with a comprehensive understanding of its operations and customer interactions.
